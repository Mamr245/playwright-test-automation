<h1 align="center">Playwright Automation Project :computer:</h1> 

### :question: What is this?
This project contains automated tests for https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/. 
It helped me explore many Playwright features while applying what I learned in the course [Playwright: Web Automation Testing From Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/playwright-from-zero-to-hero/).
It runs every Wednesday using GitHub Actions and you can check the results [here](https://github.com/Mamr245/playwright-test-automation/actions). 

### :hammer: Technologies used
`Playwright` `VSCode`

### :speech_balloon: Have any suggestions or have found an issue? 
Feel free to reach out! I'm always open to feedback and eager to improve.
