<h1 align="center">Playwright Automation Project :computer:</h1> 

### :question: What is it about?
This project is a set of automated tests performed on https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/. 
This website contains several automation challenges that gave me the opportunity to use a wide variety of features present within Playwright.
The goal was to apply what I learned during the course [Playwright: Web Automation Testing From Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/playwright-from-zero-to-hero/).
It runs everyday using GitHub Actions and the results can be checked [here](https://github.com/Mamr245/playwright-test-automation/actions). 

### :hammer: Used Technologies

### :speech_balloon: Have any suggestions or have found an issue? 
Feel free to tell me about it :speech_balloon: I'm always looking to improve!
